chunker.py — raw text → chunks

Part of the Discovery Lens pipeline. Takes the raw text produced by
extractor.py and splits it into chunks of 2–4 sentences, each tagged with
source metadata for downstream clustering and traceability.

Contract (see docs/data_contracts.md):
    Input:
        raw_text: str
        filename: str
        source_type: str       # "interview" | "review" | "ticket" | "usability"

        chunks: list[dict]     # one dict per chunk with keys:
            chunk_id, text, filename, source_type
